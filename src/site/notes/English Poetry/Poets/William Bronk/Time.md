There was something I meant to say 
before the spring had come
as though it were now the time 
if there ever were a time;

as in a dressing room between
two acts of an old play, 
some actor changing costume, — 
there, in the unpresented moment,
would be the thing to say. 

Now, in the radiance of spruce and cedar,
as on a winter hillside in the sun 
but the snow gone now, 
the ground tawny, 
the grass down and tangled, 
now, on the quiet earth between two seasons, 
there would be the thing to say.
