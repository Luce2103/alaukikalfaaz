Beyond the slightest doubt I find you right 
for there is nowhere any simple bliss 
or any terror not to be relieved. 

But nevertheless you promise and disturb 
and in the sad images which you enlist 
rejoicing seems equally right with weeping words.

The barely articulate arguments which you advanced 
in the quiet occluded hours of the mild night 
are clear to me and just. I have received you. 

And I will surely look for you in the streets by day
when all my mind is the dream’s for what you say.
