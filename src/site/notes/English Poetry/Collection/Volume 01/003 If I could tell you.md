Time will say nothing but I told you so,  
Time only knows the price we have to pay;  
If I could tell you I would let you know.  
  
If we should weep when clowns put on their show,  
If we should stumble when musicians play,  
Time will say nothing but I told you so.  
  
There are no fortunes to be told, although,  
Because I love you more than I can say,  
If I could tell you I would let you know.  
  
The winds must come from somewhere when they blow,  
There must be reasons why the leaves decay;  
Time will say nothing but I told you so.  
  
Perhaps the roses really want to grow,  
The vision seriously intends to stay;  
If I could tell you I would let you know.  
  
Suppose all the lions get up and go,  
And all the brooks and soldiers run away;  
Will Time say nothing but I told you so?  
If I could tell you I would let you know.


WH Auden
